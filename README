Python/TkInter version of Conway's Game of Life
Will include interesting modifications.

Potential modifications:
    - Contaigens -- a plagued cell has different survival rules and can pass
      on its plague to nearby cells.
    - Cities -- Population centers that are more forgiving of overcrowding
      than normal locations.
    - Species -- Different species interact with one another.

Interface:
    - Game will be played on a finite n x m grid displayed on a canvas
    - Clicking cells in the canvas will change their state
        - When different kinds of cells become available clicking a type of
          cell in a toolbox-type arrangement will change the kind of cell the
          user will place next
    - Users will be able to control the speed of the game's 'tick'

etc...
